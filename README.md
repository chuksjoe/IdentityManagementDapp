To set up this Dapp,follow these instructions.
- Install Node: Please install Node.js in version 8.11.3 LTS or higher.
- Ethereum Client (Optionally): Embark already comes with a blockchain simulator called Ganache. Optionally, in case we want to run a real node, 
[geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/) is a pretty good one. Check out the installation guide for our platform and verify our installation with: 
`$ geth version`
